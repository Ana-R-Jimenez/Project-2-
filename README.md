### California Unemployment Dashboard

Collaborators: Ana Jimenez, Jade Jimenez, Kate Bessonova-Belmont


### Datasource: Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS)
https://data.ca.gov/dataset/local-area-unemployment-statistics-laus/resource/b4bc4656-7866-420f-8d87-4eda4c9996ed
This dataset gives a clear view of unemployment pre-pandemic and the data for 2020 hadn't reached its final versions.
The data is not seasonally adjusted.



### Hypothesis: Do the individual areas in California follow the states overall trend?


### Introduction:
Originally our goal was to observe Covid trend in unemployment comparing to the previous years but the data was not complete for the 2020 to make proper conclusions.

Created dashboard represents California Local Unemployment Statistics. Choosing option in the dropdown menu will let observe the unemployment statistics for California counties, metropolitan areas, and state.
To be able to create the charts(distinct area types and the recent 10 years) with the mentioned above dropdown menu the dataset was filtered


For our analysis we used years 2008-2018 to observe the 3 main categories of unemployment rates for state, county, metropolitan areas.



### Methodology:

1.Reading  data(csv)

2.Creating index.html

3.Filtering data using Python and Jupyter Notebook(filtering “Seasonally Adjusted Column” and Status Preliminary/Final filtering for the years and group by area types was made in jupyter.notebook

4.Filtering data using JavaScript(as a result an array of distinct area types was created)

5.Creating charts in chart js.

6.Analyzing graphs
7.



### Analyzing graphs:

County  and Metropolitan  Area types closely follow the trend of the state data. The highest unemployment rate was fixed in 2010, the lowest in 2018.





### Conclusions:


After great economic upheaval unemployment reaches an all time high and it takes  a few years to normalize.

We use this information to analyze and give a possible prediction of what unemployment post COVID would look like.

Counties and Metropolitan areas closely follow the trend for the state itself

The general shape in the graph is a predictor of what we might see after the 2021 unemployment
